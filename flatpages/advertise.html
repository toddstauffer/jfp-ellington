<h4>Ready to Reach More Customers in Jackson?</h4>
<br/>

<p>The Jackson Free Press offers your business, service or organization a cost-effective way to reach more than <strong>69,500</strong>(*) adults readers in the Jackson Metro area, according to the 2008-9 Media Audit for the Jackson MSA. Who are these readers?</p>

<p><strong>Young.</strong> Our readership is primarily 18-45, evenly split between male and female and, as Jackson's most widely distributed newsweekly, we reach people in all parts of Jackson, the Metro and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Affluent.</strong> Over 54% of our readers have household incomes of $50,000 or more per year and 37% make over $75,000 a year. The majority have attended college, and the JFP offers the highest concentration of young readers with professional or technical jobs of any print outlet in the Jackson Metro.</p>

<p><strong>Movers and Shakers.</strong> As you might guess, JFP readers are more likely than most Jackson media consumers to spend their nights and weekends in sit-down restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and they're among the most frequent attendees at plays, college games and rock concerts. What you may not know, however, is that 33 percent of our readers plan to buy a car/truck/SUV in the next year and over 10,000 of our readers plan to remodel their home in the next 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Influential.</strong> With a marketing message in the Jackson Free Press, you can rest assured that you're reaching Jackson's young influentials -- the opinion leaders that other people turn to for recommendations and suggestions. Whether it's a banking decision, a real estate agent, where to eat dinner tonight, or the best band to hear this weekend, we like to say that the Jackson Free Press provides the words for word-of-mouth in the Jackson Metro.</p>

<p><strong>On the Town.</strong> Start with this factoid -- JFP has more cume adult readers than any local radio station has cume adult listeners. And we've got more cume adult readers than any other Jackson-based weekly or monthly. And those readers rely on the JFP to help them plan what they're going to do this evening and weekend. It's the perfect place to put your message, because many of our readers consider the ads important content!</p>

<p>Our rates are extremely competitive, and we offer comprehensive service for our small business clients, including art design, consultation and service after the sale.</p>
